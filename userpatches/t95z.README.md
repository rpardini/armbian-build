## The so-called 'hardware'

- I won't promote it or it's kind. It's shit. It's not worth your time. I won't post the product link to avoid any kind
  of promotion.
- It's a cheap chinese clone of <insert famous cheap box I can't remember> they call the "T95Z Plus" from "Sxxxxll", but
  it does not have the Sxxxxll logo on the case.
- The case is cheap plastic. Inside, I found a huge iron bar attached with glue to the cover, and a thermal "connector"
  that supposedly touches the soc heatsink when closed.
- Cheap pcb, cheap components inside. The ethernet phy makes actual physical noise when 1gbit/s is directed at it.
- Its a q201 clone with an hexagonal board and case.
- 2gb RAM and 16Gb ROM is what I bought for $50 without any idea how fake it was in 2017.
- It's the hated 8-core S912 - with fake clocks, slow bigs, slow littles, an eMMC from 2014, metal bar inside, the
  works.
- It has an AP6255 for Wifi chip.
- It has very visible, but highly inaccessible GND/TX/RX/3.3V pins between USB and SD-card reader, since only GND is at
  the edge of the board
- Has the "toothpick" button behind the audio jack connector. Pressing it causes the bootloader to boot from SD. Unless
  the bootloader is bricked on the eMMC.
- Can be de-bricked by shorting the eMMC pins on the right, which forces the bootloader to be loaded from SD. Use SD
  with original Android FW via USB Card Maker.

### Similarities

- q200: this has internal and external ethernet phy's. internal is usually 100mbit amlogic. external is commonly (?)
  realtek, 1gbit
- q201: this is a 'q201_n1' variant
- just like the Tronsmart Vega S96 (which somehow has mainline 5.10.y support/dtb!), but with an internal 1gbit phy
  instead of external realtek phy
- Beelink GT1: android firmware works, except for network.

## Stuff I've done to this board before writing this.

Just so you understand how much I don't care about this box.

- original firmware was terrible. terrible. but the remote worked and you could change the damn led colors (
  green/blue/both/none)
- flashed multiple unknown Android "custom ROMs" until "bricked", forgot about it for a year
- box somehow booted xxxELEC from USB, can't remember.
- flashed the wrong Android firmware (LP3 DDR - wrong) and bricked the box
- bricked the box and forgot about in a drawer for a few more years
- opened it up, and de-bricked by randomly shorting the emmc pins with "original" chinese firmware via USB Card
  Maker: <xxx>
- flashed multiple alternative Android firmwares, esp Beelink GT1 firmware works great, but no ethernet.
- booted up CoreELEC 9.2.x; fixed up to working remote, vcd, suspend/resume. could never install to emmc, timeout errors
  in kernel.

## READ THIS FIRST. THE TRUTH ABOUT AMLOGIC?

- https://forum.armbian.com/topic/7042-amlogic-still-cheating-with-clockspeeds/

```
This is an octa-core design made for TV boxes. IMO it's totally understandable that Amlogic does something equivalent to Intel's TurboBoost: reduce possible clockspeeds when all cores are in use. That way you end up with only 1.2 GHz when all 8 cores are busy. Given how DVFS works (increasing the VCore voltage a lot to provide laughable MHz boosts at the upper end of the DVFS scale) this is understandable both from a consumption and thermal point of view.
This is a TV box SoC made for clueless people (Android users who think 'higher number' is 'better number').
All that's necessary for S912 TV boxes to sell are some BS marketing numbers ('octa-core at 2GHz' confirmed by shitty tools like CPU-Z and Geekbench) and all that's necessary to let those S912 TV boxes work ok-ish is limiting the CPU cores to sane operational defaults. The way Amlogic implements it (controlling this stuff from a BLOB and let the kernel report only bogus numbers) allows for both.
Since all Android TV box SoC vendors play the same game I wouldn't call this cheating any more. It's just what a specific market demands (clueless people looking at irrelevant numbers instead of what's important)
```

Also: from @balbes150

```
S912 is a good platform if used correctly. Especially for servers based on Khadas VIM2 models (they have a number of unique functions to work as a server). A bunch of Khadas Vim2 (server) + VIM1 or vim2 Lite (as a workstation), very promising.
I am deeply indifferent (as a user), as it is organized in the hardware execution. I care about the end result. I compared the overclocked S905 (up to about 1.6) and the s912 without overclocking (both models were equipped with a good cooling system). The output, and if s912 uses all 8 cores at a lower frequency, it gives a significantly better result when compiling or soft processing video output than overclocked 4 cores s905. If you compare the video output to s905 and s912 without libMali and without hardware decoding (note - hardware decoding and libMali work, these are different things). s912 cope with the 720p output, s905 - not doing (pay attention, hardware decoding and libMali the comparison is not used, all the work is done on the CPU). If you add only hardware decoding (without libMali), s912 - without problems produces a full - screen video 4K, and s905 - screen video 1080p (output 4K on s905, in this mode I did not check, maybe the same thing will work). In my opinion, the only problem at the moment for full - screen video output on S9xxx is to include the possibility of Using amlogic hardware decoding in standard programs. I have already tested the intermediate solution, but there is no time to implement it all in the finished product (Armbian image).

I won't speak for all manufacturers (especially since most TV boxes in S912 is really a junk, which should not communicate), but there are normal manufacturers who give the correct information.

## Some old/NON-working balbe150 "arm-64" builds

** IMPORTANT ** Those are NOT WORKING BUILDS! After he gave up tvbox support.

- https://users.armbian.com/balbes150/arm-64/

- These images have partition table:

```
e W95 FAT16 (LBA)
```

which I can't seem to be able to mount?

but I burn it to SD, then

```
                                                                       Disk: /dev/sdc

```

there is free space at the beginning, which losetup ignores... so *for sure* something is up, what is in that free
space?

### At the eMMC, stuff is different again

There's like a 1Gb free space partition on eMMC. This is probably TSWP/TWRP android stuff, because that is the only
other thing I can get to (via boot switch)

this state is after pristine android firmware from vendor, then sd boot via aml_xx.zip to balbe150's version where I
think I ran install_aml.sh and it did its magic.

- Can customize .apk's before flashing .zip?
- Can run latest Kodi
- Termux seems a decent Linux-like environment
- Can run official Google Store apps, but Google Services makes it slow
- Kodi/F-Droid/Termux
- Seems to use the same chinese LED app
- Seems to want to be 3gb RAM, but works with 2gb
- Ethernet works, wifi works...
